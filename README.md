# Credit-Score-Exploration-and-Prediction-with-ML
Default is a highly bothersome problem in the financial industry which causes huge losses for the lender companies. Thus, it is essential for the financial institutes to estimate the default risk of its customers to minimize the uncertainty in receiving the loan repayments.
